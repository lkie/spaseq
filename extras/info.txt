# 1. Load spaseq

library(spaseq)

# 2. Read-in pre-calculated preference-scores:

scores1 <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "RNASEH1_R4b_2nt_a.txt", package="spaseq")) #This scores I have used in the paper
scores2 <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "RNASEH1_R4b_2nt_b.txt", package="spaseq")) # Scores from the second sequencing (5 min digestion)
scores3 <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "RNASEH1_R4b_2nt_c.txt", package="spaseq")) # Scores from the second sequencing (10 min digestion)
scores4 <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "RNASEH1_R4b_2nt_d.txt", package="spaseq")) # Scores from the second sequencing (60 min digestion)

# 3. Score your sequence (with either scores) - nth value provides cleavability of a bond after nth nucleotide. 
mySequence <- makeRandSeq(50)
scoreSequence(mySequence, scores1[,8:15], 6)
